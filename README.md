# HW2_Code-Assets
most needed assets.
Part 1 is the tron shader that utilizes a glow filter and an outline filter. I also implemented a quick xray shader for it.
Part 2 is the outdoor scene with a skybox, terrain and a water shader.

Inlcuded all code used. I didn't upload the skybox it was too big.
