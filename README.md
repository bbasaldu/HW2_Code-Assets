# HW2_Code-Assets
most needed assets.
Part 1 is the tron shader that utilizes a glow filter and an outline filter. I also implemented a quick xray shader for it.
For part 1 the main files i used were the Outline shader, Bloom shader,the BloomEffect Script and the Xrayz shader.
The Xray shader used the outline code given in section and simply has a 3rd pass with a zwrite stencil.

Part 2 is the outdoor scene with a skybox, terrain and a water shader.
I implemeneted the code given in class which included the Simple Mesh script and the HillFromTexture Shader. I then implemented the Water shader that was referenced in class. I also used an external skybox
Keys W and S move the terrain up and down a bit but theres a limit.

All other files were meant to animate objects or they were practice and i forgot to take them out.

Inlcuded all code used. I didn't upload the skybox it was too big.
